<h2>Hypercycle Simulation</h2>

<p>
This model simulates a hypercycle described by Eigen and Schuster in 1979. A hypercycle is a prebiotic model which demonstrates how stable structures (e.g. life forms) can or will emerge.
The main problem with information carrying chemical structures is the problem of reproduction. First of all a self replicating chemical structure has to provide a device for replication
so it can replicate itself.<br>
A simple replication device fits into a small (short) chemical structure so it can be encoded in the structure itself. A simple replication device will make failures during the replication
process so the information carrying chemical structure will loose its information from generation to generation. A stable information transfer is no possible and the chemical structure can
not grow to encode more information. The longer the information structure is the more errors will occur during the replication process.<p>
A higher sophisticated replication process or some repair mechanism will reduce the probability of errors but won't fit into a short chemical structure. The result is a chemical structure
can't get behind an information barrier. The amount of the encoded information will remain small and can't grow due to the problems in the replication process.<br>
As a result life could not emerge from simple chemical structures (so we are not existent).<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Eigen">Eigen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schuster">Schuster</a> proposed a simple model where the information is
distributed to different molecules which are supporting each other. All together contain more information than a single molecule. In the proposed model a number of different model types
exists where each molecule supports the existence and replicating of an other molecule type of the hypercycle. As a result the molecules supports each other.<br>
The model was first formulated as a system of differential equations that demonstrated that the hypercycle will work and the molecules will survive and replicated itself. But shortly after the
proposal of the model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Smith">John Maynard Smith</a> correctly criticized the model because of the likely existence of a parasite molecule.
A parasite molecule is a molecule that is supported by one molecule type of the hypercycle but will not support any molecule type of the hypercycle. The existence of such a molecule
is very likely because it can result by a mutation during the replication process. If such a molecule is more supported as any other molecule of the hypercycle the hypercycle is "drained",
will become unstable and collapses.<br>
The problem has been solved by Hogeweg and Boerlijst in 1990 using a cellular automaton instead a set of differential equations. During the simulation it was observed the
molecules will build spatial structures which pushes the parasite molecules away from the supporting molecules so the parasites will not be supported and vanishes.<p>
The model works the following way:
<ol>
<li>A cell filled with a molecule (state > 0) has in every cycle a certain chance to become empty (denoted by state 0). This probability is given by the parameter decay.</li>
<li>Every empty cell (patch) can be filled by a reproduced molecule of the surrounding neighbours (north, west, south, east) or remains empty. The neighbour is chosen by a computed
probability that results by the support these neighbours got by the surrounding molecules.</li>
<li>Every molecule has a certain chance to reproduce itself. This is defined by the constant s[i] where [i] denotes the i_th entry for the corresponding molecule i. The value for every s[i] is 1 by default.</li>
<li>Due to the hypercycle a molecule gets some support to reproduce itself if its predecessor is in the neighbourhood. This support value is 100 which raises the probability a molecule will reproduce itself into an empty cell.</li>
<li>A parasite molecule (state 1) will get more support of one state state as any other state will receive from an other.</li>
</ol>
At the start the grid is randomly filled with molecules. The evolution of every simulation step is computed. The diffusion method of Toffoli and Margolous is used to mix the molecules on the grid to
simulate diffusion in the reaction. Running the program the hypercycle is simulated. You'll observe the spatial patterns emerge after approx. 200 cycles and later the spiral waves. The
parasite is encoded red and will usually vanish because the hypercycle becomes inert to the parasites because of these spatial patterns.
<p>
This program is a short demonstration of the hypercycle, it is not a sophisticated program or provides a sophisticated GUI. Have fun playing with it, alter the parameters and feel free to write a nice GUI for this application. If you have any

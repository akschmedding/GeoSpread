This is version 0 of the MASON 2D constraint-based rigid body physics
package, designed by Christian Thompson.  The package has limited
documentation, but in addition to the classdocs, we are also including
Christian's masters project writeup and presentation, which are chock full
of physics engine documentation goodness. 

To install this package, just add the physics2d directory to your
CLASSPATH. Alternatively you can unpack the files into the appropriate
directories in MASON, or create a jar file and stick that in your
CLASSPATH. 

The package is intended to provide a reasonably efficient, pure-Java 2D
physics simulation package for small robotics or other needs. If you're
looking for something more complete (or in 3D), we suggest looking into
odejava (http://odejava.org/), a set of Java bindings to the Open Dynamics
Engine (http://ode.org/), a well-respected low-resolution rigid body
simulator for games and robotics.  We're examining the possibility of
encorporating odejava as part of the MASON package. 

The 2D simulation package contains several tutorials in the app directory
to get you up to speed, plus some additional application examples. 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to post them to the
MASON-INTEREST mailing list.
